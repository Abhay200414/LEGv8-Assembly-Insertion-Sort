# LEGv8-Assembly-Insertion-Sort
This project implements an insertion sort algorithm in LEGv8 assembly language. It demonstrates low-level programming concepts, including array manipulation, procedure calls, and sorting algorithms. The implementation breaks down the insertion sort into smaller procedures to manage complexity and adhere to ARMv8 calling conventions.
